'tis best then if you pray for the soul of your friend . no time for small talk . is the person who controlled you in that castle over there ? maria , take richter and leave here . i will finish this . not while there is breath in my body . so you are the one who was controlling belmont . why did you make belmont lord of this castle ? but belmont is power is supreme among vampire hunters . none other could defeat him . but your plan has failed . you claim to love the darkness . go then and dwell there for all eternity ! father   i was hoping we would not see each other again . i can not allow you to leave here . father . think you i would forget such a thing ? no . but neither do i seek revenge against them . dracula . in the name of my mother . i will defeat you again . go back whence you came ! trouble the soul of my mother no more ! you have been doomed ever since you lost the ability to love .        she said  do not hate humans . if you cannot live with them , then at least do them no harm . for their is is already a hard lot .  she also said to tell you that she would love you for all of eternity   
you seem human and yet   what do you here ? then we have the same purpose . i will trust you for now . i am maria . who are you ? not the talkative type i can see . well , perhaps we will meet again if you live that long . farewell . so we meet again , alucard . as friendly as ever , i see . it is strange . this castle is different than i remember it . so i can not trust my memories , huh ? oh well , i will do my best . good luck . impressive . you are very strong . you are right . do you know the name richter belmont ? he disappeared about a year ago and i am sure he is here . if you see him , please let me know . thank you . so you do know how to be a gentleman . alucard ! how is richter ? i see   thank you for stopping him   do you suppose that this too is fate ? no , not until i learn what caused richter is madness . you as well alucard . good bye . so did you find richter ? really ? so he is here ! that can not be true ! you are wrong ! i   i must go now ! alucard ? i am sorry . you were right . he has joined forces with the enemy   but someone must be controlling him   whatever we do , we can not harm richter . i know . well  here . take these with you . if you wear them , you can see beyond evil illusions . thank you alucard , for saving richter . all right   good luck . 
oh it is you , master alucard . what do you need ? young master , i cannot aid one who opposes the master . really ? in that case just tell me what you need . 
that voice ! alucard , it is you ! no alucard ! do not come here ! it is all right ! if my death can save others , i gladly surrender my life . yes alucard ! watch me die and remember always my last words to you   you must despise humans . they are to be your prey . better for them to die than to let them compound their sins . begin by slaying that one over there . what is wrong ? alucard ? what do you mean ! ? kill them and bring them happiness ! 
you broke free of my spell . i like that . come here little boy and show me what you have got . darkling ! i smell you are blood . you are a vampire   could it be   that strength , that beauty   you are the son of lord dracula . 
you have done well in making it this far . i would expect no less from the son of our master . yes . i am the dark priest called shaft . this world must be cleansed in the forge of chaos . for centuries , vampire hunters have defeated evil with holy power . but if two vampire hunters were to fight each other   exactly . that is why i removed him as a threat by making him into lord of this castle . has it indeed ? we will see what happens after i destroy your weak human side . ugh  no ! but   but my goal is achieved   count dracula has come to purify this corrupt world with the searing flames of chaos !
