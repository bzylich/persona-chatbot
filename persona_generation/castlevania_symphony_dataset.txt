Richter: Die monster. You don't belong in this world!
Dracula: It was not by my hand that I am once again given flesh. I was called here by humans who wish to pay me tribute.
Richter: Tribute!?! You steal men's souls and make them your slaves!
Dracula: Perhaps the same could be said of all religions...
Richter: Your words are as empty as your soul! Mankind ill needs a savior such as you!
Dracula: What is a man? A miserable little pile of secrets. But enough talk... Have at you!
Death: Ah, Alucard. What is your business here?
Alucard: I've come to put an end to this.
Death: Still befriending mortals... I'll not ask you to return to our side. But I demand you cease your attack.
Alucard: I will not.
Death: You shall regret those words... We will meet again.
Maria: You seem human and yet... What do you here?
Alucard: .......... I've come to destroy this castle.
Maria: Then we have the same purpose. I'll trust you for now. I'm Maria. Who are you?
Alucard: .......... Alucard.
Maria: Not the talkative type I can see. Well, perhaps we'll meet again if you live that long. Farewell.
Alucard: It's been a long time, old one....
Master Librarian: Oh it's you, Master Alucard. What do you need?
Alucard: I need your help.
Master Librarian: Young master, I cannot aid one who opposes the Master.
Alucard: You won't go unrewarded...
Master Librarian: Really? In that case just tell me what you need.
Maria: So we meet again, Alucard.
Alucard: It seems so.
Maria: As friendly as ever, I see. It's strange. This castle is different than I remember it.
Alucard: ......... This castle is a creature of Chaos. It may take many incarnations.
Maria: So I can't trust my memories, huh? Oh well, I'll do my best. Good luck.
Maria: Impressive. You're very strong.
Alucard: .......... What is it you want? You didn't come here to tell me that.
Maria: You're right. Do you know the name Richter Belmont?
Alucard: Of the Belmont Clan? Of course, but...
Maria: He disappeared about a year ago and I'm sure he's here. If you see him, please let me know.
Alucard: As you wish, my lady.
Maria: Thank you. So you do know how to be a gentleman.
Alucard: Who are you!!
Richter: Open Hell's gate! Come forth my servants!
Alucard: The scent of your blood... You're a Belmont!
Richter: Crush this flea who invades my castle!
Alucard: I'm certain that was a Belmont. So he says he's the lord of this castle...
Richter: I've been waiting for you.
Alucard: Answer me. Why is a Belmont planning the resurrection of Count Dracula?
Richter: Count Dracula rises but once every century and my role is over. If I can resurrect him, then the battle will last for eternity!
Alucard: ........ If those are your true feelings then so be it.
Alucard: It's over... Belmont.
Richter: So the war between humans and vampires finally ends here...
Alucard: ........
Richter: What need for the shepherd when the wolves have all gone... My time on this world has come to an end...
Alucard: So you made it.
Maria: Alucard! How is Richter?
Alucard: I'm sorry...
Maria: I see... Thank you for stopping him... Do you suppose that this too is Fate?
Alucard: ......... So your journey is over as well then?
Maria: No, not until I learn what caused Richter's madness.
Alucard: I understand... Well then, may the Gods guard you along the way. Farewell.
Maria: You as well Alucard. Good-bye.
Alucard: !! Mother!!
Lisa: That voice! Alucard, it's you!
Alucard: I'm coming Mother! I'll save you!!
Lisa: No Alucard! Don't come here!
Alucard: But Mother!
Lisa: It's all right! If my death can save others, I gladly surrender my life.
Alucard: Mother! No!... Please! No!...
Lisa: Yes Alucard! Watch me die and remember always my last words to you...
Alucard: Yes Mother...
Lisa: You must despise humans. They are to be your prey.
Alucard: What?!...
Lisa: Better for them to die than to let them compound their sins. Begin by slaying that one over there.
Alucard: No...it wasn't like this...
Lisa: What's wrong? Alucard?
Alucard: My mother never said such a thing...
Lisa: What do you mean!? Kill them and bring them happiness!
Alucard: No! You're not my mother! What kind of demon are you!?
Succubus: You broke free of my spell. I like that.
Alucard: Demon, death is too good for you!
Succubus: Come here little boy and show me what you've got.
Succubus: Darkling! I smell you're blood. You're a vampire... Could it be...
Alucard: ..........
Succubus: That strength, that beauty... You're the son of Lord Dracula.
Alucard: Death in the dream world will set your soul wandering for eternity, Demon.
Maria: So did you find Richter?
Alucard: I don't know if he's the one you're looking for, but I found a Belmont.
Maria: Really? So he is here!
Alucard: But the one I saw was the enemy. He was the lord of this castle...
Maria: That can't be true! You're wrong! I... I must go now!
Maria: Alucard?
Alucard: That voice? Maria?
Maria: I'm sorry. You were right. He has joined forces with the enemy...
Alucard: So it was a Belmont after all...
Maria: But someone must be controlling him... Whatever we do, we can't harm Richter.
Alucard: But he must be stopped.
Maria: I know. Well...here. Take these with you.
Alucard: What are these?
Maria: If you wear them, you can see beyond evil illusions.
Alucard: Thank you. 'Tis best then if you pray for the soul of your friend.
Richter: No... What have I done...
Maria: Thank you Alucard, for saving Richter.
Richter: Alucard!? The same Alucard who fought alongside my ancestor Trevor Belmont?... That was over 300 years ago!
Alucard: No time for small talk. Is the person who controlled you in that castle over there?
Richter: Yes, I think so...
Alucard: Maria, take Richter and leave here. I'll finish this.
Maria: All right... Good luck.
Death: So you've made it this far... In the name of your Father, cease this foolishness.
Alucard: Not while there is breath in my body.
Death: Then for the Master, I'll feast on your soul this night!
Shaft: You have done well in making it this far. I would expect no less from the son of our Master.
Alucard: So you are the one who was controlling Belmont.
Shaft: Yes. I am the dark priest called Shaft. This world must be cleansed in the forge of chaos.
Alucard: Why did you make Belmont lord of this castle?
Shaft: For centuries, vampire hunters have defeated evil with holy power. But if two vampire hunters were to fight each other...
Alucard: But Belmont's power is supreme among vampire hunters. None other could defeat him.
Shaft: Exactly. That's why I removed him as a threat by making him into lord of this castle.
Alucard: But your plan has failed.
Shaft: Has it indeed? We'll see what happens after I destroy your weak human side.
Shaft: Ugh...No!
Alucard: You claim to love the darkness. Go then and dwell there for all eternity!
Shaft: But... but my goal is achieved... Count Dracula has come to purify this corrupt world with the searing flames of chaos!
Alucard: Father...
Dracula: Well met. my son! It's been a long time.
Alucard: I was hoping we would not see each other again. I can't allow you to leave here. Father.
Dracula: You have ever been the ally of humans. Have you forgotten what they did to your Mother?
Alucard: Think you I would forget such a thing? No. But neither do I seek revenge against them.
Dracula: Still uttering the same nonsense. No matter. Now is the time to put aside your weak human side and join me in remaking this world!
Alucard: Dracula. in the name of my mother. I will defeat you again.
Alucard: Go back whence you came! Trouble the soul of my mother no more!
Dracula: How? How is it that I've been so defeated?
Alucard: You have been doomed ever since you lost the ability to love.
Dracula: Ah...sarcasm. 'For what profit is it to [a] man if he gains the world, and loses his own soul'?. Matthew 16:26 I believe.
Alucard: .........
Dracula: Tell me. What... what were Lisa's last words?
Alucard: She said "Do not hate humans. If you cannot live with them, then at least do them no harm. For their's is already a hard lot." She also said to tell you that she would love you for all of eternity...
Dracula: Lisa, forgive me. Farewell my son...
